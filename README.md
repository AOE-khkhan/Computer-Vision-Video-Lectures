## Signal Processing

* **Signals and Systems 6.003 (MIT), Prof. Dennis Freeman**  
[Course website](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-003-signals-and-systems-fall-2011/lecture-videos/)

  Signals and Systems 6.003 covers the fundamentals of signal and system analysis, focusing on representations of discrete-time and continuous-time signals (singularity functions, complex exponentials and geometrics, Fourier representations, Laplace and Z transforms, sampling) and representations of linear, time-invariant systems (difference and differential equations, block diagrams, system functions, poles and zeros, convolution, impulse and step responses, frequency responses). Applications are drawn broadly from engineering and physics, including feedback and control, communications, and signal processing.
    

* **Digital Signal Processing ECSE-4530 (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), Richard Radke**  
[Course website](https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~rjradke/dspcourse.html) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuh62Q4Sv7BUSzx5Jr8Wrxxn-U10qG1et)

  This course provides a comprehensive treatment of the theory, design, and implementation of digital signal processing algorithms. In the first half of the course, we emphasize frequency-domain and Z-transform analysis. In the second half of the course, we investigate advanced topics in signal processing, including multirate signal processing, filter design, adaptive filtering, quantizer design, and power spectrum estimation. The course is fairly application-independent, to provide a strong theoretical foundation for future study in communications, control, or image processing. This course was originally offered at the graduate level but retooled in 2009 to be senior-level. 


* **Digital Signal Processing (EPFL), Paolo Prandoni, Martin Vetterli**  
[Course website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dsp)

  In this series of four courses, you will learn the fundamentals of Digital Signal Processing from the ground up. Starting from the basic definition of a discrete-time signal, we will work our way through Fourier analysis, filter design, sampling, interpolation and quantization to build a DSP toolset complete enough to analyze a practical communication system in detail. Hands-on examples and demonstration will be routinely used to close the gap between theory and practice.

[Course website](https://vision.in.tum.de/teaching/online/cvvm) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTBdjV_4f-EJ7A2iIH5L5ztqqrWYjP2RI)

  Variational Methods are among the most classical techniques for optimization of cost functions in higher dimension. Many challenges in Computer Vision and in other domains of research can be formulated as variational methods. Examples include denoising, deblurring, image segmentation, tracking, optical flow estimation, depth estimation from stereo images or 3D reconstruction from multiple views.

  In this class, I will introduce the basic concepts of variational methods, the Euler-Lagrange calculus and partial differential equations. I will discuss how respective computer vision and image analysis challenges can be cast as variational problems and how they can be efficiently solved. Towards the end of the class, I will discuss convex formulations and convex relaxations which allow to compute optimal or near-optimal solutions in the variational setting.


* **Computer Vision II: Multiple View Geometry (TU München), Prof. Daniel Cremers**  
[Course website](https://vision.in.tum.de/teaching/online/mvg) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTBdjV_4f-EJn6udZ34tht9EVIW7lbeo4)

  The lecture introduces the basic concepts of image formation - perspective projection and camera motion. The goal is to reconstruct the three-dimensional world and the camera motion from multiple images. To this end, one determines correspondences between points in various images and respective constraints that allow to compute motion and 3D structure. A particular emphasis of the lecture is on mathematical descriptions of rigid body motion and of perspective projection. For estimating camera motion and 3D geometry we will make use of both spectral methods and methods of nonlinear optimization.

  This course emphasizes research topics that underlie the advanced visual effects that are becoming increasingly common in commercials, music videos and movies. Topics include classical computer vision algorithms used on a regular basis in Hollywood (such as blue-screen matting, structure from motion, optical flow, and feature tracking) and exciting recent developments that form the basis for future effects (such as natural image matting, multi-image compositing, image retargeting, and view synthesis). We also discuss the technologies behind motion capture and three-dimensional data acquisition. Analysis of behind-the-scenes videos and in-depth interviews with Hollywood visual effects artists tie the mathematical concepts to real-world filmmaking.
